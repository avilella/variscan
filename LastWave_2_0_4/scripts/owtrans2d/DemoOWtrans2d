# Demo file for the owtrans2d package
#
#


#
# When the package owtrans2d is loaded, two &owtrans2 variables are defined : a2 and b2
# (look in the file owtrans2d.pkg). 
# You can use them as the "current object" ("objCur") by just typing their names as
# a command (e.g., just type "a2" and you will see that the prompt that indicates
# the name of the current object as well as its type will be "a2 (&owtrans2) > ").
#

# Accessing the images of a owtrans2 variable (when it is the objCur):
#
#   The image to analyze is referred to as 0
#   The image representing octave <oct> and orientation <orient>  is simply <oct><orient>
#     the <orient> could be 1 (X transform), 2 (Y transform) or 3 (XY transform).
#     the <orient> could be 0 for <noct> being the largest octave (it corresponds to the 
#     last Vj projection)
#   The images 1 to 9 are just images available for the user which are never used 
#   by wavelet reconstruction/decomposition.
