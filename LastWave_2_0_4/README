All the instructions for installing and using LastWave can 
be found in the LastWave documentation or (a shorter version) in the files 
INSTALL_XXX (where XXX is the type of system you have).

On the LastWave web site you can download the documentation and the reference manual
either in a postscript format or in a pdf (acrobat) format. 
Both have been generated using Latex.

The best thing you should do is to print the LastWaveDocumentation.ps file 
and read the first pages which will tell you about the Copyright of LastWave 
and about how to install LastWave on your computer.

If you want to see some tutorial demos of LastWave, just run LastWave, type 'Demo' and follow
the instructions.
