# RANGE OF ANALYSIS
# The following parameters let you define the regions of your alignment 
# that should be analysed. A region can be either defined with the RefPos,
# StartPos and EndPos parameters, or by using a BDF file

# StartPos parameter
# Lets you define the first position of the analysis. 

StartPos = 0

# EndPos parameter
# Lets you define the end of the analysis. If EndPos is set to 0,
# the program will perform analysis to the end of the alignment. Else,
# EndPos must be equal or larger than StartPos

EndPos = 0

# RefPos parameter
# 1: The numbers given in StartPos and EndPos are positions
#       in the reference sequence 
# 0: The numbers given in StartPos and EndPos are positions
#       in the alignment

RefPos = 0

# BLOCK DATA FILE parameter
# You can use a Block Data File (BDF) to define regions of analysis.
# If a file is given, StartPos and EndPos parameters
# will be ignored. The RefPos parameter is still in effect though.
# So the start and end values given in the BDF are either positions
# in the reference sequence or positions in the alignment
# Exemaple:  BlockDataFile = data/test.bdf

# SEQUENCE NAMES for MAF format files
# Since the number of Individuals may vary from one information block to
# another (MAF files), the program cannot determine
# the full set of sequences at the beginning of the file.
# The names of all individuals should be given as values of the
# parameter IndivNames, separated by whitespace. 
# If the alignment file is not a MAF file, 
# this parameter will be ignored

# DEFINING INDIVIDUALS
# The following parameters let you include or exclude sequences for
# analysis, define outgroups and define the reference sequence
# SeqChoice parameter

# that let you choose the individuals to include in the analysis.

# OUTGROUP parameter
# A group of integers for all individuals, separated by whitespace, 
# that defines the outgroups in your alignment. The outgroups are 
# defined by giving them values larger than 0. The higher the number, 
# the larger the phylogenetic distance to the ingroup.
# 0: Individual is in the ingroup

# etc.
# Note: Currently, only 1 outgroup is used in the analysis

# Outgroup = 1 4  (sequences 1 and 4 are close outgroups )

# that is to be used as the reference sequence. This individual does not
# necessarily have to be included in the analysis

# RunMode parameter
# This parameter defines the types of analysis to be performed:
# 11,12,13,... is for summary statistics without an ougroup
# 21,22,23,... is for summary statistics with an outgroup
# 31,32,33,... is for phased data block-correlation statistics (LD, HD, Fu's Fs)
# 41,42,43,... empty
# 51,52,53,... tests, converting formats and other random bits
#
# 11: Summary statistics without an outgroup and no assumptions 
#        (Pi, Theta)
# 12: Summary statistics without an outgroup with assumptions
#        (Pi, Theta, Tajima_D, Fu_and_li_D_star, Fu_and_li_F_star)
# 21: Summary statistics with an outgroup (Pi, K)
#       - there has to be an outgroup defined
# 22: Summary statistics with an outgroup II 
#       (FuLi's F, FuLi's D, FayWu's H)
#       - there has to be an outgroup defined
#       - sites with non-informativ outgroup will be discarded
# 31: Linkage disequilibrium, haplotype diversity and Fu's Fs
#       (D, D', R-2, HD, Fu's Fs) 
#       - only works for complete deletion!
# 51: No analysis, but convert alignment file to a PHYLIP file
#       - does not work for MGA files!

# SEGREGATING SITES / MUTATIONS

# HANDLING OF GAPS AND MISSING DATA

#       for Tajima's D, Fu&Li's D and Fu&Li's F will be calculated.

#       If a site contains more valid nucleotides
#       than defined in NumNuc, nucleotides will be randomly chosen
#       from that column. This will allow the program to calculate
#       the standard statistics for Tajima's D, Fu&Li's D and
#       Fu&Li's F (i.e. always using the same number of sequences)
# 0: A minimum: sites that contain at least the number of valid
#       nucleotides for the ingroup sequences
#       defined in NumNuc will be included in analysis, all valid
#       nucleotides are taken into account. Since this value may
#       vary from site to site, only the non-standard statistics
#       for Tajima's D, Fu&li's D and Fu&Li's F can be calculated

FixNum = 0

# NumNuc parameter
# Defines the fixed/minimal number of ingroup nucleotides to be used for 
# analysis. Sites that contain less valid bases than the defined number 
# will be discarded. Depending on the value, the program can only calculate 
# specific statistics for each RunMode. These are listed below:
# 1: Only valid for RunMode = 2. Only K will be calculated
# 2: Valid for RunModes 1 and 2. In RunMode 1 only Pi and Theta will
#       be calculated
# 3: Valid for RunModes 2 and 3 (all statistics) and RunMode 1 (only
#       Pi and Theta)

# of the window are based on
