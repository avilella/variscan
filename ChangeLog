	- This changelog will report releases from now on. Use cvs to
	check changes in the cvs version

	- added support for overlapping BDF blocks. As long as the start
	values are sorted in the BDF file, the blocks may overlap.

	- added reference positions in the SW output. The calculation of
	statistics is still base on the total alignment positions, but the
	first and last reference position in a window are also calculated.

        * pop.[ch]
	
	- Now contains all functions handling the selection of sequences
	and outgroups

	* free.[ch]
	
	- Contains all functions for memory-freeing

	* output.[ch]
	
	- stuff that goes onto the screen (and later into the files)

	* statistics.[ch]
	
	- calculation of statistics (Pi, Theta, Tajima, etc.)

	* window.[ch]
	
	- handling of the sliding windows and BDF blocks

	* Makefile.am
	
	- changed file for correct compilation and linking
	
20040304  Stephan Hutter

	* variscan.[ch]

	- theta and tajima_D for pairwise deletion
	
20040303  Stephan Hutter

	* variscan.[ch]

	- variscan now also calculates Theta and S (# of segregating
	sites) for PHYLIP files in a sliding window fashion

	- calculations of Tajima's D for the SW have been included,
	concerning the number of segregating sites

	- calculations for Theta and Tajima's D should also work for
	pairwise (still not tested)

	- speeded-up the algorithms for the calculation of the SW and the
	polymorphism statistics, new code is 10-20x faster

	- fixed a small bug that caused problems when calculating the
	final window
	
20040209  Stephan Hutter

	* variscan.20040128.h:
		
	- added variables chosenNumSeq (total number of chosen sequences
	for ingroup) and chosenNumOut (total number of outgroups) to
	vscanFile
                                                                                                                                
	- added a list for chosen seqs and chosen outgroups in vscanBlock
                                                                                                                                
	- added some variables to vscanPolyArray: monomorph (number of
	monomorphic sites in the array), gapAmb (number of sites with gaps
	or ambiguities in the array), notanalysed (number of sites that
	are not stored in the array)
                                                                                                                                
	- added the variable boolGap to configFile. It allows the user to
	choose if sites with gaps or ambiguities should be included in
	analysis
                                                                                                                                
	- added structure vscanOutgroup. Contains a pointer to the
	sequence of the outgroup and the phylogenetic info given in the
	config file

	* variscan.20040128.c
	
	- added calculations of pi for the complete stretch currently in
	memory. Should be part of statistics.c, but is put here because of
	problems when including that file.
                                                                                                                                
	- the seqChoice feature is now working. Statistics (namely pi)
	will be calculated only on the basis on chosen sequences in the
	config file. The polyarray is now only filled with nucleotides
	from the chosen sequences.
                                                                                                                                
	- changed the code so now also sites with gaps or ambiguities can
	be included in calculations.
                                                                                                                                
	- added some procedures which create dlLists of the chosen
	sequences and the chosen outgroups. Outgroups are automatically
	sorted by their phylogentic distance to the ingroup.
                                                                                                                                
	- changed vinfo->start to 1 at initialization.
                                                                                                                                
	- for testing reasons, the polyArray along with the
	vscanPolySummary is printed for each stretch together with
	additional parameters and Pi per site.

	* data/example.conf
 
	- changed exemple.conf to work with the new parameters

	* data/SARS.conf

	- changed SARS.conf to work with the new parameters
 
	* data/s.conf

	- changed s.conf to work with the new parameters
 
	* data/chr1.axt.conf

	- changed chr1.axt.conf to work with the new parameters

2004-01-30  Stephan Hutter

	* variscan.20040128.c:

	- changed reading of filenames in phylipFirstStretch so no white
	space is required between name and start of sequence

	* pop.c:

	- changed size of *words[256] to *words[128] inside writeMgaNames. 

	- removed variable *cloneName inside writeMgaNames because it
	was unnecessary.
	
2004-01-27  Albert Vilella
	
	* pop.c: MgaName array typo.
	
	* statistics.c: Uninitalized boolean in count haplotypes.
	
2004-01-27  Albert Vilella

	* variscan.20040116.c: Debugged problem with freeanalysedpart. Now
	should work smoothly.

2004-01-27  Stephan Hutter

        * renamed parameter binSeqVector to seqChoice inside the conf-file

        * added parameter outgroup to conf-file

        * changed SARS.conf and s.conf to work with the new parameter
	(for testing)

        * added function to create a vpop with a list of n=numSeq vindivs

        * updated loadConfigFile to read seqChoice and outgroup and put it
	into the corresponding vindiv

        * changed phylipFirstStretch to read out sequence names and put
	them into vindiv->name

        * added function writeMgaNames to write the standard names of MGA
	files into vindiv->name

        * added function popOutput which shows the summary of
	population parameters at the end of a run (to check if everything
	worked)
